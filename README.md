# üß™ PrivScan Demo App (Health-themed Dummy App)

This is a minimal **dummy Android app** designed to demonstrate the usage and effectiveness of [PrivScan](https://github.com/buyanghc/PrivScan), a privacy interface analysis SDK.

The app follows a **healthcare theme** and has the **PrivScan SDK already integrated**. It contains **four static front-end GUI pages**, with no real backend or interactive functionalities. The purpose is to simulate common mobile UI scenarios for privacy analysis.

## üîç App Features

The app includes the following types of pages:

1. **Page with both privacy-related icon and text elements**
2. **Page with only privacy-related icon elements**
3. **Page with only privacy-related text elements**
4. **Page with neither icon nor text privacy indicators**

These examples aim to cover typical interface variations seen in real-world apps.

## üìú Privacy Policy

The app includes a **mock privacy policy**, available [here](https://buyanghc.github.io/fittrack-policy/index.html).  
*Note: This policy is entirely fictional and generated for demonstration purposes.*

## üì¶ Who is this for?

This app is intended for users who:

- Want to evaluate **PrivScan‚Äôs interface analysis** capabilities  
- Do **not** have their own app ready for testing  
- Prefer a simple, no-setup way to view how the SDK works across various GUI scenarios
